I have a wonderful wife and two fantastic children.  I spend most of my time trying to be a scientist.  When I'm not working, I'm spending time with my children and my wife.  Or maybe I'm using an hour or two (too many!) to decompress with a fantasy or science fiction book, show, or game.

Before we had children, Nicole and I liked to travel and play.  We both like hiking, tree climbing, frisbee, parkour, gymnastics, eating, tennis, sleeping, and pickleball.
