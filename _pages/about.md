About me
---
I am a computational plasma physicist at the University of Michigan.  I'm a PhD student in Applied and Interdiscplinary Mathematics and Scientific Computing. 
Plasma physics is a subject I found midway through my PhD.  It is a field connected immediately to many exciting applications and several frontiers of fundamental science, including compact accelerators and radiation sources, high-field physics, high energy density science, extreme astrophysics, laboratory astrophysics, fusion energy, hall thrusters, heliophysics, and more.

I study plasma-based acceleration and numerical methods for plasma simulation.  

I developed a scheme for dephasingless photon acceleration using tapered plasma profiles.  I developed an analytic nonlinear model for the wake behind an ultrarelativistic drive beam in the tapered density profile.  I then solve a coupled set of differential equatios for the plasma profile and predicted laser pulse frequency.  Incorporating the derived profile in plasma simulation using the plasma codes OSIRIS and FBPIC, the laser pulse achieves 5-10x frequency shift in simulations.

I also developed the plasma code FARRSIGHT.  It is an adaptive semi-Lagrangian particle method for an integral form of the Vlasov Poisson system.  I developed a custom smoothly periodic regularization of the Green's function.  This is employed in a barycentric Lagrange interpolating treecode (BLTC), and deployed on GPU for more than 1000x speedup over direct sum CPU calculations, for the problem sizes I've studied.  I developed an adaptive (modified) quadtree structure compatible with a hierarchy of interpolation schemes; I have used bilinear and biquadratic interpolation.


Personal

I spend most of my time trying to be a scientist. When I'm not working, I'm spending time with my wife, Nicole, and my children Angel and Ty.  Or maybe I'm using an hour or two (too many!) to decompress with a fantasy or science fiction book, show, or game.

We like hiking, tree climbing, frisbee, parkour, gymnastics, eating, tennis, sleeping, and pickleball.
