FARRSIGHT is a forward semi-Lagrangian particle method for the
Vlasov-Poisson system in which the particle number density 
is represented on adaptively refined and remeshed panels in phase space,
and an integral form of the Poisson equation is solved using a regularized electric field kernel
and a GPU-accelerated hierarchical treecode.
We describe the method and present numerical results encompassing
Landau damping,
two-stream instability,
and
halo formation in a particle beam.
