In this talk we present a new forward semi-Lagrangian particle method for the Vlasov-Poisson (VP) system. 
Recently developed methods for the VP system include deformable particles and high-order or discontinuous-Galerkin Eulerian methods. 
In contrast to these, we do not use any operator splitting and obtain the electric field by summing regularized pairwise particle interactions using a GPU-accelerated tree-code. 
We remesh and use adaptive mesh refinement to maintain an efficient representation of phase space. 
We benchmark on several standard test cases including Landau damping and the two-stream instability. 
We also compare the multi-threaded and single-GPU performance of the method.
