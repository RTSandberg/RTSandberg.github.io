A Forward Adaptively Refined and Regularized Semi-Lagrangian Integral Green's function Hierarchical Tree-code accelerated method for the Vlasov-Poisson system
---

We present a new forward semi-Lagrangian particle method for the Vlasov-Poisson (VP) system. 
Recent methods for solving the VP system include deformable particles and high-order and/or discontinuous-Galerkin Eulerian methods. 
In contrast to these, we do not use any operator splitting and obtain the electric field by summing regularized pairwise particle interactions using a hierarchical treecode. 
We use remeshing and adaptive mesh refinement to maintain an efficient representation of phase space. 
We benchmark on several standard test cases including Landau damping and the two-stream instability.
